This tracker is for issues that:

* Are not relevant to the community, e.g. deeply composed tasks
* Discuss internal company processes such as Sprints and long term planning
* Span multiple repos and have no clear primary repo

Please continue using project-specific repositories for as many
issues as possible. 

## coder/coder goals

`coder/coder` is for end-users to connect with Coder engineers and product managers. Our most important issues will always live there. Bugs/improvements for released features should always live there.

Please write issues in `coder/coder` in a way that engages users.

## rules of thumb

1. A public issue (even in this repo) should never link to a private resource such as a Notion page, Slack thread, etc.
   1. Take screenshots of slack threads, publish notion pages, or simply copy
   relevant information into the issue.
1. All issues, regardless of repository, should have a body.
1. If you have an issue and think there's basically zero chance a user would react/comment on it, put it here.

## this is weird

Most companies solve the problem of open source tracker bloat by moving
a lot of core development activity into private trackers such as JIRA. We
have opted for a different approach because:

* Sometimes it's hard to know where an issue should live, GitHub makes it easy to move issues between repositories
* We want developers to be highly comfortable with GitHub as a tool
* GitHub projects makes it easy to track issues across repositories, so we can
avoid a painful syncing process between a public and internal tracker
* If a community member begins engaging with the internal tracker, we can
use it as a sign that that type of issue should be moved to coder/coder


# transfers

On some interval, @ammario and the PMs will move issues between here and the
community. Please take this as a sign that the issue should've been originally
created in a different place.

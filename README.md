This repo is for issues that:

* Are not relevant to the community, e.g. deeply composed tasks
* Heavily discuss internal company processes such as Sprints and long term planning
* Discuss named customers or other private information
* Span multiple repos and have no clear primary repo

Please continue using public, project-specific repositories for as many
issues as possible. Try to write issues in a way that engages users.
